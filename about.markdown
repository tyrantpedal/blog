Since you clicked the `About` link, I suppose you want to know a bit about me.

I have worked for many years in software development (mostly web apps) as a software engineer and recently in more leadership roles.  

Along came COVID and I found myself unemployed.  This was actually a blessing in disguise.

For some time now I was feeling increasing burnout in my work and had been contiplating a career shift into my true passion, *Information Security*, specifically on the Red Team side.

Before I lost my job, I had enrolled in the [eLearnSecurity Penetration Tester Student (PTS)](https://www.elearnsecurity.com/course/penetration_testing_student/){:target="_blank"} and had been slowly plugging away at it in my spare time.  With more time now, I quickly finished that course and took my **eLearnSecurity Junior Peneteration Tester (eJPT) certification** exam (passing).

After obtaining my eJPT certification, I enrolled in the [Offensive Security Penetration Testing With Kali (PWK)](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/){:target="_blank"} course in order to obtain my Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification.  This is my current area of study and the reason for this site.

I found myself continually searching the same things over and over during my studies, so this site is a collection of those things in one spot.  Maybe it will be helpful for someone else.

That brings us up-to-date.
